If you’re like me, you can’t help but bookmark every R-related programming book you find in the hopes that one day you, or someone you know, might find it useful. Hopefully this is the only bookmark you’ll need in future ;). When I initially released this collection in late August 2020, it contained about 100 books that I’d been collecting over the previous two years. Since then I’ve found a few more and there have been contributions from many people. The collection now stands at over 300 books. Most of these are free. Some are paid but usually quite affordable. 1.2 Searching If there’s something specific you’re looking for, use the menu or search using the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. 1.3 Contributing Please feel free to contribute paid and free books - see GitHub. 1.4 Contributors If you’ve contributed, add your name and Twitter / blog link below!

I’m guessing that if you’re interested in R then you also like data ;). Note that “unique” visits will be higher in Plausible than you’d find with Google Analytics. Because Plausible is GDPR compliant and privacy focused, each user is identified for only 1 day. If someone visits the site 2 days in a row, that’s counted as 2 “uniques” whereas in Google Analytics it would only be counted as 1 unique visitor because of the presence of persistent cookies and such that allows for tracking of users.

R book clubs are usually a group of people who follow along together in working though the same book, with some sort of periodic check-in (often weekly, often via video) discussing the text, exercises and solutions. Below is a list of book clubs. These usually have a specific start and end date, so it may happen that a book club has already ended even though it’s listed here. If you are running a book club, feel free to add it. 3.1 NHS-R community If you’re one of the estimated 10 000 data analysts working in the NHS or someone who works closely with the NHS or health data, here’s a blog post introducing the NHS-R Community book club. The book club is coordinated through the NHS-R Slack Group and the specific channel is #book-club. Certain email addresses can just join the Slack group (like @nhs.net) but if you have an email address that needs approval please contact NHS-R Community through their contact details on the website. The book club has covered statistics books like The Art of Statistics by David Spiegelhalter and The Book of Why by Judea Pearl and presentations given at the meetings can be found on the GitHub repository. The Community will be coordinating another book club for the R4DS book and the channel for that is #r4ds-book-club. 3.2 R4DS Slack Community The R4Ds slack Community has a number of running book clubs. Once you’ve joined the slack group, you can search for channels. They also have a channel specifically for book club facilitators! They’ve recorded the sessions of cohorts so you can pick your way through one, or catch up on the current one! 3.3 R-ladies Netherlands - Advanced R by Hadley Wickham A collaboration of multiple Netherlands-based R-ladies groups ran a club on Hadley Wickham’s Advanced R book.

Hiring Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers is a concise, practical guide to cut through the confusion. Whether you’re the founder of a brand new startup, the senior vice president in charge of “digital transformation” at a global industrial company, the leader of a new analytics effort at a non-profit, or a junior manager of a machine learning team at a tech giant, this book will help walk you through the important questions you need to answer to determine what role and which skills you should hire for, how to source applicants, how to assess those applicants’ skills, and how to set your new hires up for success. Special emphasis is placed on in-office vs remote hiring situations. Paid: varies $25 Link: https://dshiring.com ## Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews Book by Chip Huyen This book is the result of the collective wisdom of many people who have sat on both sides of the table and who have spent a lot of time thinking about the hiring process. It was written with candidates in mind, but hiring managers who saw the early drafts told me that they found it helpful to learn how other companies are hiring, and to rethink their own process. The book consists of two parts. The first part provides an overview of the machine learning interview process, what types of machine learning roles are available, what skills each role requires, what kinds of questions are often asked, and how to prepare for them. This part also explains the interviewers’ mindset and what kind of signals they look for. The second part consists of over 200 knowledge questions, each noted with its level of difficulty – interviews for more senior roles should expect harder questions – that cover important concepts and common misconceptions in machine learning.

One solution to this is to use a programming language such as R to analyse archaeological data, with authors sharing their R code with their publications to communicate our methods. This practice is becoming widespread in many other disciplines, but few archaeologists currently know how to use R or have an opportunity to learn during their training. In this forum we tackle this problem by discussing ubiquitous research methods of immediate relevance to most archaeologists, by using interactive, live-coded demonstrations of R code by archaeologists who program with R. Topics include getting data into R, working with C14 dates, spatial analysis and map-making, conducting simulations, and exploratory data visualizations. Link: https://benmarwick.github.io/How-To-Do-Archaeological-Science-Using-R/ ## Quantitative Methods in Archaeology Using R by David L. Carson The first hands-on guide to using the R statistical computing system written specifically for archaeologists. It shows how to use the system to analyze many types of archaeological data. Part I includes tutorials on R, with applications to real archaeological data showing how to compute descriptive statistics, create tables, and produce a wide variety of charts and graphs. Part II addresses the major multivariate approaches used by archaeologists, including multiple regression (and the generalized linear model); multiple analysis of variance and discriminant analysis; principal components analysis; correspondence analysis; distances and scaling; and cluster analysis. Part III covers specialized topics in archaeology, including intra-site spatial analysis, seriation, and assemblage diversity.

Something that the R community calls “Rtistry.” My Rtistry journey so far has been an amazing and tranquil expedition into a world that seemed intimidating and scary on the outside but is honestly just a bottomless pit of fun and creativity on the inside. I’m going to talk about some very basic concepts and perspectives you can think about while starting your own Rtistry journey in ggplot. This includes basics on geoms, aesthetics, layering, etc. But then I’m also going to walk you through two of my Rtistry examples and code to get you started. This article is intended for those who have some experience with ggplot building in R but may not have realized how to transition from making “regular” visuals to Rtistry. This article goes over basic concepts that more seasoned users may already know.

Link: https://math.unice.fr/~cbouveyr/MBCbook/ ## Modern Data Science with R by Benjamin S. Baumer, Daniel T. Kaplan, Nicholas J. Horton This book is intended for readers who want to develop the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects and “think with data” (as coined by Diane Lambert of Google). The desire to solve problems using data is at the heart of our approach. We acknowledge that it is impossible to cover all these topics in any level of detail within a single book: Many of the chapters could productively form the basis for a course or series of courses. Instead, our goal is to lay a foundation for analysis of real-world data and to ensure that analysts see the power of statistics and data analysis. After reading this book, readers will have greatly expanded their skill set for working with these data, and should have a newfound confidence about their ability to learn new technologies on-the-fly. This book was originally conceived to support a one-semester, 13-week undergraduate course in data science. We have found that the book will be useful for more advanced students in related disciplines, or analysts who want to bolster their data science skills. At the same time, Part I of the book is accessible to a general audience with no programming or statistics experience. Link: https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ ## Modern Statistics with R by Måns Thulin This book covers the fundamentals of data science and statistics.

Link: https://smithjd.github.io/sql-pet/ ## R for Data Engineers by Greg Wilson Years ago, Patrick Burns wrote The R Inferno, a guide to R for those who think they are in hell. Upon first encountering the language after two decades of using Python, I thought Burns was an optimist—after all, hell has rules. I have since realized that R does too, and that they are no more confusing or contradictory than those of other programming languages. They only appear so because R draws on a tradition unfamiliar to those of us raised with derivatives of C. Counting from one, copying data rather than modifying it, lazy evaluation: to quote the other bard, these are not mad, just differently sane. Welcome, then, to a universe where the strange will become familiar, and everything familiar, strange. Welcome, thrice welcome, to R.

That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time. But here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be. This book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies. Link: https://ona-book.org/ ## Handbook of Regression Modeling in People Analytics by Keith McNulty It is the author’s firm belief that all people analytics professionals should have a strong understanding of regression models and how to implement and interpret them in practice, and the aim with this book is to provide those who need it with help in getting there.

On this page we outline the course and present the Syllabus. 2018/2019 was the first time that we taught this course in this format, so we are in year 3 now. Link: https://scpoecon.github.io/ScPoEconometrics ## Introduction to R for Econometrics by Kieran Marray This is a short introduction to R to go with the first year econometrics courses at the Tinbergen Institute. It is aimed at people who are relatively new to R, or programming in general. The goal is to give you enough of knowledge of the fundamentals of R to write and adapt code to fit econometric models to data, and to simulate your own data, working alone or with others. You will be able to: read data from csv files, plot it, manipulate it into the form you want, use sets of functions others have built (packages), write your own functions to compute estimators, simulate data to test the performance of estimators, and present the results in a nice format. Most importantly, when things inevitably go wrong, you will be able to begin to interpret error messages and adapt others’ solutions to fit your needs.

Imagine, further, that researchers and decision-makers acting in the public interest had tools enabling them to test and model such data to explore different scenarios of the future. People would be able to make more informed decisions, based on the best available evidence. In this technocratic dreamland pressing problems such as climate change, inequality and poor human health could be solved. These are the types of real-world issues that we hope the methods in this book will help to address. Spatial microsimulation can provide new insights into complex problems and, ultimately, lead to better decision-making. By shedding new light on existing information, the methods can help shift decision-making processes away from ideological bias and towards evidence-based policy.

Nowhere more so than in the delivery of healthcare. From the understanding of disease and the development of new treatments, to the diagnosis and management of individual patients, the use of data and technology are now an integral part of the business of healthcare. Those working in healthcare interact daily with data, often without realising it. The conversion of this avalanche of information to useful knowledge is essential for high-quality patient care. An important part of this information revolution is the opportunity for everybody to become involved in data analysis. This democratisation is driven in part by the open source software movement – no longer do we require expensive specialised software to do this. The statistical programming language, R, is firmly at the heart of this. This book will take an individual with little or no experience in data science all the way through to the execution of sophisticated analyses. We emphasise the importance of truly understanding the underlying data with liberal use of plotting, rather than relying on opaque and possibly poorly understood statistical tests. There are numerous examples included that can be adapted for your own data, together with our own R packages with easy-to-use functions.

Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc This is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or the delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the health training curricula are already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them. This book is for you.

Link: https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis ## Handbook of Graphs and Networks in People Analytics With Examples in R and Python by Keith McNulty The technology of graphs is all around us, and enables so many of the ways in which we live our lives today. That same technology is also available to us at no cost as an analytic tool to allow us to better understand network structures and dynamics in the fields of science, technology, economics, sociology and psychology to name just a few. It is available to academics and practitioners alike, and can be used on problems ranging from a very small network analysis which takes a few minutes on a laptop, to massive scale network mining requiring days or weeks of processing time. But here’s the problem: few people really know how to do network analysis. It is still considered by many as a deep specialism or even a ‘dark art.’ It shouldn’t be. This book aims to make the field of graph and network analysis more approachable to students and professionals by explaining the most important elements of theory and sharing common methodologies using open source programming languages like R and Python. It does so by explaining theory in as much detail as is necessary to support analytical curiosity and interpretation, and by using a wide array of example data sets and code snippets to demonstrate the specific implementation and interpretation of methodologies.

Sonderegger This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R. I believe that while people can get by with just copying code chunks, that doesn’t give them the background information to modify the code in non-trivial ways. Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a “crash-course” would.

Link: https://michael-franke.github.io/intro-data-analysis/index.html ## An Introduction to R by Alex Douglas, Deon Roos, Ana Couto, Francesca Mancini, David Lusseau The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research. R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting. We have tried to simplify the content of this book as much as possible and have based it on our own personal experience of teaching (and learning) R over the last 15 years. It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R - that would be an impossible task. Neither is it intended to be an introductory statistics course, although you will be using some simple statistics to highlight some of R’s capabilities. The main aim of this book is to help you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your experience in using R.

The concept for a recipe card is that they are self contained, providing all the ingredients, preparation, and instructions required to create a meal. While a cookbook may consist of many recipes, there is no expectation to read, understand, and master all the recipes in order to prepare a meal. Following this as the central theme the book, it has been designed as a number of data analytics recipes focusing on the R language.

It emphasizes what you need to know to be able to use the language in any context. There is no fancy statistical analysis here. We just present the basics of the R language itself. We do not assume that you have done any computer programming before (but we do assume that you think it is about time you did). Experienced R users obviously need not read this. But the material may be useful if you want to refresh your memory, if you have not used R much, or if you feel confused.

Peng, Sean Kross, Brooke Anderson This book covers R software development for building data science tools. This book provides rigorous training in the R language and covers modern software development practices for building tools that are highly reusable, modular, and suitable for use in a team-based environment or a community of developers. Paid: Free or pay what you want $20 Link: https://leanpub.com/msdr ## Metaprogramming in R by Thomas Mailund Learn how to manipulate functions and expressions to modify how the R language interprets itself. This book is an introduction to metaprogramming in the R language, so you will write programs to manipulate other programs. Metaprogramming in R shows you how to treat code as data that you can generate, analyze, or modify. Paid: $20 Link: https://amzn.to/2x1cYUR ## Modern R with the tidyverse by Bruno Rodrigues This book can be useful to different audiences. If you have never used R in your life, and want to start, start with Chapter 1 of this book. Chapter 1 to 3 are the very basics, and should be easy to follow up to Chapter 9. Starting with Chapter 9, it gets more technical, and will be harder to follow. But I suggest you keep on going, and do not hesitate to contact me for help if you struggle! Chapter 9 is also where you can start if you are already familiar with R and the {tidyverse}, but not functional programming. If you are familiar with R but not the {tidyverse} (or have no clue what the {tidyverse} is), then you can start with Chapter 4. If you are familiar with R, the {tidyverse} and functional programming, you might still be interested in this book, especially Chapter 9 and 10, which deal with package development and further advanced topics respectively.

My name is Wendy Huynh and I am a current PhD student working in the behavioral neurosciences. I began my R journey at the end of my first year of graduate school, slowly and painfully piecing together code. Although programming was never really part of my program, I now see it as an integral part of my work. Many fellow graduate students expressed interest in learning R, but didn’t know where to begin. Programming with R is still relatively niche among my cohort and there are very few formal classes teaching this subject. Although there are many amazing guides/textbooks for R out there, very few of them featured examples relevant for my specific needs and were user-friendly enough for a true beginner. In the Fall of my second year, I began teaching a new graduate student in my lab everything I knew about R. However, I quickly found that teaching R – even just to one person – was very time consuming. I decided to write up assignments as a “short” guide to R. After writing a short 11 page “first assignment” and receiving positive feedback, I began writing up a second assignment. Then a third. Soon enough, I had written enough pages that I couldn’t deny that this “short guide” had turned into a book.

Kabacoff Teaches you to use the R language, including the popular tidyverse packages, through hands-on examples relevant to scientific, technical, and business developers. Focusing on practical solutions to real-world data challenges, R expert Rob Kabacoff takes you on a crash course in statistics, from dealing with messy and incomplete data to creating stunning visualisations. In this revised and expanded third edition, new coverage has been added for R’s state-of-the-art graphing capabilities with the ggplot2 package. Paid: $30 Link: https://www.manning.com/books/r-in-action-third-edition ## R language for programmers by John D Cook I have written software professionally in perhaps a dozen programming languages, and the hardest language for me to learn has been R. The language is actually fairly simple, but it is unconventional. These notes are intended to make the language easier to learn for someone used to more commonly used languages such as C++, Java, Perl, etc. Link: https://www.johndcook.com/blog/r_language_for_programmers/ ## Rcpp for everyone by Masaki E. Tsuda Rcpp is a package that enables you to implement R functions in C++. It is easy to use even without deep knowledge of C++, because it is implemented so as to write your C++ code in a style similar to R. And Rcpp does not sacrifice execution speed for the ease of use, anyone can get high performance outcome. This document focuses on providing necessary information to users who are not familiar with C++. Therefore, in some cases, I explain usage of Rcpp conceptually rather than describing accurately from the viewpoint of C++, so that I hope readers can easily understand it. Link: https://teuder.github.io/rcpp4everyone_en/ ## The R Inferno by Patrick Burns If R’s behaviour has ever suprised you, then this book is a guide for many more surprises, written in the style of Dante. It’s a concise report on number of common-errors and unexpected behaviours in R. This book would make more sense, if you have been programming and are familiar with such behaviours (not all though), as there is little time spent on explaining why part of behaviour. As mentioned, it’s a concise book, 126 pages only. Link: https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf ## The R Language by R Core team A collection of manuals: 1. An Introduction to R 1.

Let me make something very, very clear… I did not write this book. This whole story started in the Summer of 2015. I was taking a late night swim on the Bodensee in Konstanz and saw a rusty object sticking out of the water. Upon digging it out, I realized it was an ancient usb-stick with the word YaRrr inscribed on the side. Intrigued, I brought it home and plugged it into my laptop. Inside the stick, I found a single pdf file written entirely in pirate-speak. After watching several pirate movies, I learned enough pirate-speak to begin translating the text to English. Sure enough, the book turned out to be an introduction to R called The Pirate’s Guide to R.

First, I hope you will gain a solid understanding of how access to big data (digital traces) is changing the social sciences in terms of a) new substantial and theoretical insights, and in terms of b) new methodologies. Second, I hope you will learn which and how big data could be used to answer further pressing questions you might encounter in the future. Link: https://bookdown.org/paul/2021_computational_social_science/ ## Computing for the Social Sciences by Dr. Benjamin Soltoff The goal of this course is to teach you basic computational skills and provide you with the means to learn what you need to know for your own research. I start from the perspective that you want to analyze data, and programming is a means to that end. You will not become an expert programmer - that is a given. But you will learn the basic skills and techniques necessary to conduct computational social science, and gain the confidence necessary to learn new techniques as you encounter them in your research. We will cover many different topics in this course, including: - Elementary programming techniques (e.g. loops, conditional statements, functions) - Writing reusable, interpretable code - Problem-solving - debugging programs for errors - Obtaining, importing, and munging data from a variety of sources - Performing statistical analysis - Visualizing information - Creating interactive reports - Generating reproducible research Link: https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/intro-to-course/ ## Crime by the Numbers A Criminologist’s Guide to R by Jacob Kaplan This book introduces the programming language R and is meant for undergrads or graduate students studying criminology. R is a programming language that is well-suited to the type of work frequently done in criminology - taking messy data and turning it into useful information. While R is a useful tool for many fields of study, this book focuses on the skills criminologists should know and uses crime data for the example data sets. Link: https://crimebythenumbers.com/ ## HR Analytics in R by Chester Ismay, Albert Y. Kim, Hendrik Feddersen The intention of this book is to encourage more ‘data driven’ decisions in HR. HR Analytics is not anymore a nice-to-have addon but rather the way HR practitioners should conduct HR decision making in the future. Where applicable, human judgement is ‘added’ onto a rigorous analysis of the data done in the first place. To achieve this ideal world, I need to equip you with some fundamental knowledge of R and RStudio, which are open-source tools for data scientists. I am well aware that on one side you want to do something for your career in HR, however you are most likely completely new to coding.

I offer some general considerations and specific answers. Link: https://plain-text.co/index.html#introduction ## Using R for Data Analysis in Social Sciences A Research Project-Oriented Approach by Quan Li This book seeks to teach undergraduate and graduate students in social sciences how to use R to manage, visualize, and analyze data in order to answer substantive questions and replicate published findings. This book distinguishes itself from other introductory R or statistics books in three ways. First, targeting an audience rarely exposed to statistical programming, it adopts a minimalist approach and covers only the most important functions and skills in R that one will need for conducting reproducible research projects. Second, it emphasizes meeting the practical needs of students using R in research projects. Specifically, it teaches students how to import, inspect, and manage data; understand the logic of statistical inference; visualize data and findings via histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and diagnostic plots; and analyze data using one-sample t-test, difference-of-means test, covariance, correlation, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, and model assumption diagnostics. Third, it teaches students how to replicate the findings in published journal articles and diagnose model assumption violations. Paid: Incl listing of library availability $40 Link: https://www.worldcat.org/title/using-r-for-data-analysis-in-social-sciences-a-research-project-oriented-approach/oclc/1048009316 ## Using R for Social Work Research by Jerry Bean Our goal for this document is to illustrate the importance of good data analysis practices and how R and companion packages support these practices. We think the R system has many benefits for social work research. R has become the flagship computing environment for many areas of science and has great appeal because it is free and open-access. In addition, free tools like RStudio and R Markdown promote a replication commitment and open science philosophy important to our work.

Even though there is no mathematical prerequisite, the authors still introduce fairly sophisticated topics such as likelihood theory, zero-inflated Poisson, and parametric bootstrapping in an intuitive and applied manner. The case studies and exercises feature real data and real research questions; thus, most of the data in the textbook comes from collaborative research conducted by the authors and their students, or from student projects. Every chapter features a variety of conceptual exercises, guided exercises, and open-ended exercises using real data. After working through this material, students will develop an expanded toolkit and a greater appreciation for the wider world of data and statistical modeling. Link: https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ ## Causal Inference: The Mixtape by Scott Cunningham Causal inference encompasses the tools that allow social scientists to determine what causes what. In a messy world, causal inference is what helps establish the causes and effects of the actions being studied—for example, the impact (or lack thereof) of increases in the minimum wage on employment, the effects of early childhood education on incarceration later in life, or the influence on economic growth of introducing malaria nets in developing regions. Scott Cunningham introduces students and practitioners to the methods necessary to arrive at meaningful answers to the questions of causation, using a range of modeling techniques and coding instructions for both the R and the Stata programming languages. Link: https://mixtape.scunning.com/ ## Common statistical tests are linear models a work through by Steve Doogue This is a reworking of the book Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats), written by Jonas Lindeløv. The book beautifully demonstrates how many common statistical tests (such as the t-test, ANOVA and chi-squared) are special cases of the linear model. The book also demonstrates that many non-parametric tests, which are needed when certain test assumptions do not hold, can be approximated by linear models using the rank of values.

From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing ﬁrst, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, t-tests, ANOVAs and regression. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book. Link: https://learningstatisticswithr-bookdown.netlify.app/ ## Library of Statistical Techniques by Nick Huntington-Klein, Volunteers In short, LOST is a Rosetta Stone for statistical software. LOST is a publicly-editable website with the goal of making it easy to execute statistical techniques in statistical software. Each page of the website contains a statistical technique — which may be an estimation method, a data manipulation or cleaning method, a method for presenting or visualizing results, or any of the other kinds of things that statistical software typically does. For each of those techniques, the LOST page will contain code for performing that method in a variety of packages and languages. It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What’s the R equivalent of that command you know about in Stata or SAS, or vice versa? Link: https://lost-stats.github.io/ ## Mixed Models with R Getting started with random effects by Michael Clark Mixed models are an extremely useful modeling tool for situations in which there is some dependency among observations in the data, where the correlation typically arises from the observations being clustered in some way. Link: https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/ ## Model Estimation by Example Demonstrations with R by Michael Clark This document provides ‘by-hand’ demonstrations of various models and algorithms. The goal is to take away some of the mystery of them by providing clean code examples that are easy to run and compare with other tools. The code was collected over several years, so is not exactly consistent in style, but now has been cleaned up to make it more so. Within each demo, you will generally find some imported/simulated data, a primary estimating function, a comparison of results with some R package, and a link to the old code that was the initial demonstration.

Parlett-Pelleriti, Guy Prochilo, Frederik Aust The goal of Superpower is to easily simulate factorial designs and empirically calculate power using a simulation approach. The R package is intended to be utilized for prospective (a priori) power analysis. Calculating post hoc power is not a useful thing to do for single studies. This package, and book, expect readers to have some familiarity with R (2020). However, we have created two Shiny apps (for the ANOVA_power &amp; ANOVA_exact functions respectively) to help use Superpower if you are not familiar with R. Reading through the examples in this book, and reproducing them in the Shiny apps, is probably the easiest way to get started with power analyses in Superpower.

Real statistical problems, however, are complex and subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is a book about how to use regression to solve real problems of comparison, estimation, prediction, and causal inference. It focuses on practical issues such as sample size and missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps right in to methods and computer code you can use fresh out of the box. PDF is free for personal use Link: https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/ ## Spatio-Temporal Statistics with R by Christopher K. Wikle, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Noel Cressie We live in a complex world, and clever people are continually coming up with new ways to observe and record increasingly large parts of it so we can comprehend it better (warts and all!). We are squarely in the midst of a “big data” era, and it seems that every day new methodologies and algorithms emerge that are designed to deal with the ever-increasing size of these data streams. It so happens that the “big data” available to us are often spatio-temporal data. That is, they can be indexed by spatial locations and time stamps. This book provides an accessible introduction, with hands-on applications of the methods through the use of R Labs at the end of each chapter.

Grassroots groups have sprung up around the world to teach programming, web design, robotics, and other skills to free-range learners. These groups exist so that people don’t have to learn these things on their own, but ironically, their founders and teachers are often teaching themselves how to teach. There’s a better way. Just as knowing a few basic facts about germs and nutrition can help you stay healthy, knowing a few things about cognitive psychology, instructional design, inclusivity, and community organization can help you be a more effective teacher. This book presents key ideas you can use right now, explains why we believe they are true, and points you at other resources that will help you go further Link: http://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html ## What they forgot to teach you about teaching R by Desiree de Leon This book is offered at rstudio::global(2021), as part of the Diversity Scholars program.

It was an inspiring experience from which I learned a great deal. My colleagues patiently explained the principles of Agile software development and together we applied them to the data science context.All these experiences culminated in the workflow that we now adhere to at work and I think it is worthwhile to share it. It is heavily based on the principles of Agile software production, hence the title. We have explored which of the concepts from Agile did and did not work for data science and we got hands-on experience in working from these principles in an R project that actually got to production.

Link: https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/ ## How I Use R by David Keyes There are many great learning resources at the beginner stage and some incredible tutorials to master complex tasks in R. But, drawing from a concept in urban planning, there are far fewer resources in the middle. Stretching the metaphor perhaps to its breaking point, new R users at the “detached single-family home” stage can’t get to the advanced “mid-rise” level without going through the middle stage. The “missing middle” in the R neighborhood is the lack of resources to that answer the types of nuts and bolts questions that new R users often have. Things like: How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality? This book is my attempt to provide answers to these types of questions.
